make

make install

if make does not work for you and you have no time to find out why go download a binary distribution and start over first.

what it is supposed to do?

in the right order 'compile' each of the projects then call 'link' then 'cpy'

whats known to go wrong?

casts and calls - this software was developed with vc - not as portable as we claimed - altrough we did test it on
gentoo and ubuntu as well as sun


odaba 

1. download http://run-software.com/downloads/linux/odaba-~-bin-amd64.tar.bz2
2. tar xjf odaba-20060717-bin-amd64.tar.bz2
3. cd odaba && make install
4. cd /opt/odaba/ && ./sbin/ODABAShell
    TestRuntime

uninstall

make installs creates 
/opt/odaba/ 
/etc/odaba
/etc/init.d/odabaserver
~/odaba 

during runtime you possibly create /tmp/odaba and /var/run/odabaserverd.pid


some scripts and ini-files (odabaserver) depend ond /data/data/ 

if you delete the mentioned files odaba is uninstalled.
possibly changed files should not be in /opt* because you are not root. copy the dist directory into a directory where you have control and
use the odabashell to operate in this directory. if you feel like releasing your changes, (uninstall &&) make install.
