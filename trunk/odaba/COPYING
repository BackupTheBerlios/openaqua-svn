Sorry i did not manage to find out what license we distribute this 
software. usaly the discussion ends with details on licensing but not
the entire decision.

while odaba is stated as 'free' and 'open source' this just means
that you can use the libs but you cannot make money with the help
of the tools.
pretty complicated to explain:
when you are making money using the tools (making means you get paid
and have the money) - then you should license whatever you needed
using a personal agreement with run-software.com

as long as you make free software(not price but gpl) you may use the lib

if you need a specific licensing model or support contact 
reinhard@run-software.com

if you got a argument why it should be license X tell us too!
