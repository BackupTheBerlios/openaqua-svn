\brief    License definition
          License  definitions define the conditions for  using a database or an
          application  based  on  the  database. By means of license conditions,
          the  duration of use, the number of users or a termination date can be
          defined.  License definitions  can be  provided for each customer, but
          also  as  a  general  license  (test  license).  The  general  license
          determines  the conditions, under which any user can use a database or
          applications.
          Running  the License  utility with  the proper  owner name and license
          number  activates  licenses  for  a  user. The License utility must be
          executed  once for  each dictionary,  where the license information is
          stored for further use.
