\brief    Title
          Topics  are  used  to  refer  to details that are defined in a certain
          context.  In  contrast  to  concepts  and terms that are more abstract
          topics  describe details as part of  a whole. While "Person" defines a
          concept,  "Anthon Miller" would be described as a detail. Thus, topics
          usually  describe concrete things (concrete  is always relative to the
          concepts the detail belongs to).
